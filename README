Overview: This project is built on a Freescale 9S12C microcontroller written in C programming. It is a robot car that can move around without hitting any object on its way. It utilized infrared sensor to detect obstacle and 2 DC motor to make turns. Five modules on 9S12C were deployed to achieve the goal. 

Component: Infrared sensor, motor driver, infrared sensor, LCD display.

9S12C Microcontroller Module

RTI: Remote Control
TIM: Sensor Signal Control
PWM: Motor Speed Control
ATD: Signal Converter
SPI: LCD Display
